# No translator? No problem!
i know that everything on the panel is made in Polish, but that text is just saying somethin like 'attention, u can get banned..." blah blah blah (i use it for 5 months and didnt get banned)
# How to use
~*download only the html file!!*~
NAH! now no need to download!!
just go to https://nazwasadfh.github.io/Blooket-Cheat-Lib/ or shorter link: https://tiny.pl/01nk-s2v
# 💻on pc:
open blooket site
open browser console (e.g. chrome one is ctrl+shift+j)
and paste copped script


# 📱on phone:
~OLD WAY:
install 'kiwi browser beta' (not that one from google play) by going to https://github.com/kiwibrowser/src.next/releases/tag/14310011181
(or any other browser with dev tools, but i think its the only one)
open blooket site
press 3 dots and developer tools
dev tools will open in other tab. press the square to change the tab. you can now paste these scripts normally.~
NEW WAY:
1. install Lemour Browser app (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lemurbrowser.exts) and go to blooket site (most of cheats work only in game).
2. press the 4 blocks button on the down bar
3. press devtools ans go to console
4. paste your copped script from tiny.pl/01nk-s2v
(dev tools open in new tab. to go back to blooket, just change the tab. it may sometimes require to re open the devtools)
